# Self-Balancing-Cube

Our version of the software for the self-balancing cube, simplified and modified for our needs.
It is planned to add a mechanical brake in the future in order to allow the cube to stand ub by himself.

We plan two projects :
- First we will do a 1-axis version of the project to experiment with the circuit and values we should use
- Second we will do the full scale version

We also planned a simple motor testing program.
All the project will be done on Arduino since this is the board we have with us. If you want to replicate this with an ESP32, you will have to modify several things, including using the led PWM functionnality.
