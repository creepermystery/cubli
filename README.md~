# Self-Balancing-Cube

Our version of the software for the self-balancing cube, simplified and modified for our needs.
It is planned to add a mechanical brake in the future in order to allow the cube to stand ub by himself.

We plan two projects :
- First we will do a 1-axis version of the project to experiment with the circuit and values we should use
- Second we will do the full scale version

We also planned a simple motor testing program.
